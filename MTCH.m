function [std] = MTCH(Z)
% The Multiplicative-error-based Three-Cornered Hat (MTCH) method calculates the root-mean-squared-
% error (RMSE) between three or more sets of data (from 
% different measurement systems) and the true.
% 
%The difference between MTC Hand classical TCH is that in MTCH the error model 
% is multiplicative which is more appropriate in case of e.g. evapotranspiration data.
%
%%% Input:
%
%       Z    is the data matrix with M rows and N columns 
%       (M is the total number of time samples in each product).
%
%%% Outputs:    
%
%       std is a 1 * N vector representing the RMSE between each of the data 
%            sets and the true.
